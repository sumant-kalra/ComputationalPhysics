Refer to the book: 'Numerical Methods by Balaguruswamy' for details on each topic

* ERRORS: 
    - Introduced at every step of numerical computing; Inevitable; Identify the sources & handle the errors.
    - Types of Errors: 
        - Measurement errors: Measurements of quantity; Every measurement has an associated error, hence represented as range.  
        - Rounding-off errors: Numbers input & storage into computing machines; representing floating point numbers using limited bits.
        - Truncation errors: Numerical process; Infinite series represented using limited terms.
        - Modelling errors: Numerical process; Assumptions & approximations in modelling.
        - Discretization errors: Numerical process; Continous quantities represented as discrete quanties.
        - Propagation of errors: Numerical process; Accumulation of different errors in the final result.
        - Human errors: Human in the loop; Blunders.

* STABILITY OF AN ALGORITHM:
    - Sensitivity of algorithm: Change in output with change in input; Unstable if small changes in input lead to large changes in output.
    - Condition number (k): Quantifies the sensitivity of the algorithm.
        - k = RelativeChange(output) / RelativeChange(input)
        - k<=1 : Well-conditioned (stable)
          k>1  : Ill-conditioned (unstable)
    - Measures the effects of different errors on the output. 
    - Usage across applications: 
        (a) Root finding problem, f(x) = 0: k = (deltaY/Y)/(deltaX/X) 
        (b) Linear algebra problems, [A]{x} = {b}: k = ||A||.||A^-1||  

* ERROR ANALYSIS:
    - Establish the accuracy of the final results.
       1. Solve with multiple analytical/numerical procedures.
       2. Stability analysis of each procedure.
       3. Convergence check: Increase the number of iterations. Note: Increasing nIter, decreases truncation errot but increases rounding-off errors; Minimize the total error.
       4. Backward Error analysis / Residual check: Substitute the result back into the original equations
       5. Forward Error analysis: Estimating the errors from each source and step to predict the error in the final result.  

    - The above steps take care of the following errors:   
        - Measurement errors: Obtain the output range for the given input range; Ok, if stable.
        - Rounding-off, Truncation, Propagation of errors, Human errors: Multiple procedures for the same problem.
        - Discretization errors: Convergence check.
        - Modelling errors: Improving the mathematical models 
    
    - Tips to reduce the total error: 
        - Increasing the significant digits of the computer; double precision instead of float 
        - Minimize the number of arithmetic operations 
        - Avoid subtractive calculations; Catastrophic cancellation
        - Choosing proper initial parameters
