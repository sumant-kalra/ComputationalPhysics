Linux Tips
===================================================================
1. Shortcuts

    ^xe                 : Edit and Execute (Note: default text editor must be set)
    sudo !!             : !! is the previously executed command
    tail -f fileName    : Real time
    ^r                  : Reverse search the commands executed
    cd -                : Back
    apropos <keyword>   : Search the keyword
    cat <file> | wc -l  : word count, number of lines	

2. alias <shortHand>="<command>"

3. File creation with cat

    cat > <newFileToBeCreated>           : Creates a new file that stores the text being typed to cmdline; Stop using ^d 
    cat << EOF > <newFileToBeCreated>      : Creates a new file that stores the text being typed to cmdline; Stop when EOF is typed   

4. Dealing with directories:

    mkdir -p ./parentDir/childDir/child2 : Creates heirarchy of the directories 
    tree                                 : Displays a tree structure of the directories 

5. lscpu : Displays processor architecture

6. netstat -tlnp
7. nc -z localhost 3306
8. fuser <fileName>
9, source <fileName>                     : Runs all the commands listed in <fileName> one by one; Useful -> Shell script but no exe permissions 
10. find <directoryPath> -name <fileName>: Searches for the fileName in all the directories and subdirectories of directoryPath	    

HPC Cluster Commands:
1. numactl -H
2. module avail                          : List of all the modules available on cluster to load
